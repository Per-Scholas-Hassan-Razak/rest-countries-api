# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher solution


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

**⚠️ NOTE ⚠️: Sometimes the REST Countries API can go down. We've added a `data.json` file with all the country data if you prefer to use that instead. However, please be aware that the data in the JSON file might not be up-to-date.**

**⚠️ INSTRUCTOR NOTE ⚠️: Due to the note above I designed and implemented the solution to this project based on the backup data provided by front end mentor. My intention was to prove out the concept and later plug in the fetch request to the real API. However, the typescript interfaces I have created as specifically geared towards the data from`data.json` and the API is now in V3 with some modifications. Therefore, the funtionality as required by the challenge sections has been completed using the local data file. And if I have time to refactor I will run some fetch requests to the updated API and see how much work would entail changing my code to fit the new data shape. But other than that the functionality is there whats missing is API fetch.
